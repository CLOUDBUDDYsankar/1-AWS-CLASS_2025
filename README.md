# DAY 2: EC2 INSTANCES ( Elastic Compute Cloud )
Today’s Focus: Amazon EC2 – The Backbone of Cloud Computing! ☁️💻
Let’s dive into hands-on server creation using various Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) 🔧👇

✅ 1. Amazon Linux AMI – Server Setup
✅ 2. Ubuntu Linux AMI – Server Setup
✅ 3. Red Hat Linux AMI – Server Setup
✅ 4. Windows AMI – Server Setup

📘 Perfect for beginners & those aiming to master EC2 server provisioning across multiple OS platforms!










What is EC2?
Amazon EC2 provides scalable compute capacity in the cloud, allowing you to launch and manage virtual servers (instances) effortlessly.

⚡ KEY FEATURES:
✅ Elasticity – Scale up/down based on demand
✅ Multiple Instance Types – Optimized for compute, memory, storage, etc.
✅ Security – VPC, Security Groups, IAM roles for access control
✅ Storage Options – EBS (persistent), Instance Store (temporary)
✅ Auto Scaling – Ensures high availability

🚀 BASIC EC2 WORKFLOW:
1️⃣ Choose an AMI (Amazon Machine Image)
2️⃣ Select an Instance Type (t2.micro, m5.large, etc.)
3️⃣ Configure Instance Details
4️⃣ Add Storage (EBS, Instance Store)
5️⃣ Configure Security Group (firewall rules)
6️⃣ Launch & Connect via SSH/RDP

🔑 EC2 PRICING MODELS:
💰 On-Demand – Pay as you go (flexible but costly)
💰 Reserved Instances – 1- or 3-year commitment (cost-effective)
💰 Spot Instances – Up to 90% cheaper, but can be terminated anytime
💰 Dedicated Hosts – Physical server reserved for you

🔥 HANDS-ON TASK:
✅ Launch a free-tier t2.micro instance
✅ SSH into the instance using .pem key
✅ Install & run a simple web server (sudo apt update && sudo apt install apache2 -y)

💬 Have you worked with EC2 before? Share your experience below! 👇

# Day 7: Secure VPC Setup with EC2 Instances
Project:

Design and configure a VPC: Create a VPC with custom IP ranges. Set up public and private subnets. Configure route tables and associate subnets.

Implement network security: Set up network access control lists (ACLs) to control inbound and outbound traffic. Configure security groups for EC2 instances to allow specific ports and protocols.

Provision EC2 instances: Launch EC2 instances in both the public and private subnets. Configure security groups for the instances to allow necessary traffic. Create and assign IAM roles to the instances with appropriate permissions.

Networking and routing: Set up an internet gateway to allow internet access for instances in the public subnet. Configure NAT gateway or NAT instance to enable outbound internet access for instances in the private subnet. Create appropriate route tables and associate them with the subnets.

SSH key pair and access control: Generate an SSH key pair and securely store the private key. Configure the instances to allow SSH access only with the generated key pair. Implement IAM policies and roles to control access and permissions to AWS resources.

Test and validate the setup: SSH into the EC2 instances using the private key and verify connectivity. Test network connectivity between instances in different subnets. Validate security group rules and network ACL settings.

By implementing this project, you'll gain hands-on experience in setting up a secure VPC with EC2 instances, implementing networking and routing, configuring security groups and IAM roles, and ensuring proper access control.
